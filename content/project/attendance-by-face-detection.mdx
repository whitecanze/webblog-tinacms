title: Automated Enhanced Facial Recognition Attendance System
description: ' This project is an automated attendance system that utilizes facial recognition technology to verify the identity of students in a classroom. The system checks and records the time when students enter and leave the classroom using facial biometrics. It aims to streamline the attendance process, reduce manual effort, and enhance security by ensuring that only authorized individuals are granted access to the classroom. The system can be integrated with existing school management systems to provide real-time attendance tracking and reporting capabilities.'
